    <h2>Project Info</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="description">
        This is a site that contains all the important kibble information for the game 
        "Ark: Survival Evolved". It is used to get info on what kind of kibble a dino
        prefers, what kind of kibble you can make with different dino eggs, as well as
        a list of all the kibble recipes.
    </p>
    <h3>My Motivation</h3>
    <p class="my-motivation">
        While playing "Ark: Survival Evolved", I hated having to always google what kibble
        a dino prefered, and when I was making kibble, I had to google which eggs I needed to
        make a certain kibble. There were no apps that solved my problem so I made this website.

        <dt>Collecting Data</dt>
        <dd>
            I didn't bother trying to find an api for this since I only need really basic 
            information, so I decided I would get the information myself and just put it in
            the Constants file. Another reason for doing it this way would be the speed, I
            figured since the information was readily available in the website files, it would
            be much quicker. Collecting this information was extremely boring and tedious and
            delayed development quite a bit.
