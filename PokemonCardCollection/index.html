    <h2>Project Info</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="description">
        This is an app that I made for myself to help manage/track my pokemon card collection.
    </p>
    <h3>My Motivation</h3>
    <p class="my-motivation">
        After watching a lot of youtubers open really old, expensive pokemon card packs, I
        wanted to get back into it myself. I was surprised at what cards were considered "high 
        value", because a lot of the cards that looked cool weren't worth nearly as much as
        some of these cards. Although I got rid of most of my collection when I was a kid,
        I still kept some, and I realized I had no way of knowing if I had one of these high 
        value cards, because I always thought the best cards had the highest hp... So I created
        this app to track all my cards

    <h3>Technologies</h3>
    <ul class="technologies">
        <li>React</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <dl class="challenges">
        <dt>Creating A Custom &lt;select&gt;</dt>
        <dd>
            I always knew &lt;select&gt;'s can only have &lt;option&gt;'s as children, but I thought
            that &lt;option&gt;'s could have whatever they wanted as children. This is not true. The
            content of an option tag can only be a string or number, but I wanted to add an 
            image and string for each option. So I had to find a way to create a custom
            drop-down list to display each card set. Luckily React has a library called react-select
            that is very customizable and looks great, so I decided to go with that.

        <dt>Status Updates/Notifications</dt>
        <dd>
            I wanted a way to let the user know that after taking some sort of action on the website, 
            that somthing is actually happening. I mainly wanted this functionality for when a user, or I,
            add a card, and if the card is successfully added, show a quick popup message, and if it failed,
            show an error message. I found a React library called react-toastify, which does exactly
            what I was looking for. It allows me to create a short popup that appears for a specified length
            of time and then it will disappear off the screen.

    <h3>Improvements</h3>
    <dl class="improvements">
        <dt>Easily Add Card</dt>
        <dd>
            Currently, You have to enter the card number and match a set icon from the drop-down
            list to the one on the bottom of the card in order to add a card to the collection. 
            Entering a number is no problem, but since
            there are a lot of sets, and the sets list is only getting larger, another solution
            would be ideal. If each card had some sort of serial number so it could be easily identified,
            that would be great. But since I can't change the way cards are made, the only other solution
            I can think of would be to implement some sort of AI that can accurately identify a pokemon card,
            but since this is out of the scope of the project, it will not be implemented.
