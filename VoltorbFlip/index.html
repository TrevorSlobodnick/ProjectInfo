    <h2>Project Info</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="description">
        This app generates all the possible solutions of a given board from the game 
        "Voltorb Flip". Voltorb Flip is a game in Pokemon Heartgold/Soulsilver that 
        is similar to Minesweeper. The goal of the game is to uncover all of the 2 
        and 3 tiles on a given board and move up to higher levels, but if the tile 
        you select is a Voltorb/bomb, you lose.

    <h3>My Motivation</h3>
    <p class="my-motivation">
        I made this website during a playthough of Pokemon HeartGold, which is a casino minigame
        within the game. I loved the idea of the game, and wanted to know the odds of winning each
        level, and therefor, wanted to know how many solutions there was for each board. I didn't find
        any solutions and thought it would a fun challenge.

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <dl class="challenges">
        <dt>Learning About Recursion</dt>
        <dd>
            Since this project is dealing with finding all solutions, I knew it would take too long
            to create every solution and go and then go through each one and only keep the ones that
            match the criteria. So I looked into recursion, and watched some tutorials on how to make
            sudoku solvers. Eventually I was able to get the hang of it, but it took a lot of tweaking
            and testing to make sure everything was working properly.

    <h3>Improvements</h3>
    <dl class="improvements">
        <dt>Design First</dt>
        <dd>
            I built this project because I was playing through Pokemon Heartgold and I didn't want
            to think about which card to flip over. I immediately jumped into solving the problem
            without any thought of what the site would actually look like. To improve the site, I
            would have wanted to design it first and make it look good on paper, then start building
            out my idea.
        </dd>
        <dt>Dynamic Result Counter</dt>
        <dd>
            After having completed the project, I thought it would be a good idea to update the solutions
            found counter as the solutions are being found, because som boards have a lot of solutions, so
            the recursive function takes a few seconds to complete. During that time it may look like the
            website is frozen, when it is actually just getting all the results. I couldn't do this because
            Javascript only runs on one thread, and in order to change the display, I would have had to change
            the code, which I did not do because I wanted to move onto other projects.
